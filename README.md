# Demo Project
This is a simple demo project for evaluating Java/Kotlin practices. 
This Project is WIP and will be extended.
The goal of this project is to create a reference project implementation for modern java/kotlin projects as 
well as playing around with frameworks/libaries or coding techniques.
